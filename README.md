# 🏢 Employee Management System

> Imagine you’re running a company.  
> You’ve got employees joining, some leaving, salaries to track, and roles to manage.  
> Spreadsheets? Too messy. Post-it notes? Forget it.  

That’s why I built the **Employee Management System** —  
a clean, role-based web app where **Admins** manage employees, and **Employees** log in to see their details.  
Nothing fancy, just practical.

## 🎬 Demo Flow
1. 👩‍💼 **Admin logs in**  
   → sees a dashboard with all employees.  

2. ➕ **Admin adds a new hire**  
   → fills a quick form (name, email, role, salary).  

3. ✏ **Admin updates records**  
   → promotions and salary hikes handled in seconds.  

4. 🗑 **Admin deletes records**  
   → when employees move on.  

5. 👨‍🔧 **Employee logs in**  
   → sees their profile neatly styled, with salary & role info.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python Flask** – keeps the backend light and fast.  
- **MySQL** – structured employee records, relational power.  
- **HTML + CSS** – styled UI (no boring tables, looks like an actual product).  
- **Sessions** – secure login for Admins & Employees.

## 🔄 System Workflow
- User opens the app → sees login page  
- If Admin → redirected to Dashboard with full employee list  
- If Employee → redirected to Profile page  
- Admin can:
  - Add new employees  
  - Update employee details  
  - Delete employees  
- Employee can:
  - Only view their own profile

## 👥 User Roles
**Admin**
- Manage all employees (CRUD operations)
- Full access to dashboard  

**Employee**
- Limited access  
- Can only view personal details

## 🚀 Why This Project?
I wanted a project that shows:
- I can **design and develop** a full-stack app.  
- I understand **databases** and can do CRUD like a pro.  
- I know how to make it look like something people might actually use.  

It’s not just “Hello World with SQL”.  
It’s a mini HR tool you could run inside a small company today.
